# -- Negative Indexing!!

# Question: Complete the script so that it prints out letter i  using negative indexing.
# letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

'''Hint: 
    It would be silly to count from start to end,
    since i is located closer to the end than to the start of the list.

letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"]

print(letters[-2])

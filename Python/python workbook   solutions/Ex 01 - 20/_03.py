# -- Compare vs Assign !!

# Question:
#   Executing the code will throw an error. Can you explain why?

a = 1
b = 2
print(a == b)
print(b == c)

'''
    Observation: 
       variable c (is not defined) 
    And == is a comparison operator.
    so, even if c was declared a & b are not equal

# --- Tip's
# 1. Be as persistent as you can before looking at hints or the solution.
# 2. Persistence is gold in programming.
# 3. Sometimes taking a break is the best thing you can do to solve a problem.
# 4. When getting an error, don't panic, but look closely at the error message.
# 5. Knowing how to fix errors is as important as knowing to write programs.
